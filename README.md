# Time to Travel 

## Project Five - Travel App (Front End Developer Udacity Nanodegree)
### What I used: HTML, CSS, Javascript (Vanilla), Webpack

#### Project Objective
To build a travel application that contains a simple form which obtains information on user's upcoming trip - destination and departure date. With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Dark Sky and Pixabay, the app then displays weather and an image of the location on that given date. This is project #5 - part of my Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree.

#### Building
To build I followed the following steps, creating: 

* Workflow to break project in small steps
* Wireframe of the website on [https://mockflow.com]
* Got my basic project setup and functioning in Visual Studio Code (HTML, installed SASS, set up a local server)
* Installed and configured Webpack (+ essential loaders and plugins)


#### Result
